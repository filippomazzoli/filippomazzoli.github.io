Further objects of interest, introduced by Hitchin, are Higgs bundles and these are tied to surface group representations by the Nonabelian Hodge Correspondence. The goal of this talk is to highlight a method by which Higgs bundles can be used to determine geometric structures on related manifolds. \(\mathrm{SU}(2,1)\)-Higgs bundles satisfying a certain condition naturally give rise to developing maps for complex hyperbolic structures. These techniques also extend to a wider class of Higgs bundles, notably a family of \(\mathrm{SO}(2,n)\)-Higgs bundles.

Larson</a>, <strong>Cohomology of Moduli Spaces of Curves</strong>.</summary> <p> </p> <p><em>Abstract:</em> The moduli space \(M_g\) of genus \(g\) curves (or Riemann surfaces) is a central object of study in algebraic geometry. Its cohomology is important in many fields. For example, the cohomology of \(M_g\) is the same as the cohomology of the mapping class group, and is also related to spaces of modular forms. Using its properties as a moduli space, Mumford defined a distinguished subring of the cohomology of \(M_g\) called the tautological ring. The definition of the tautological ring was later extended to the compactification \(\bar{M}_g\) and the moduli spaces with marked points \(\bar{M}_{g,n}\). While the full cohomology ring of \(\bar{M}_{g,n}\) is quite mysterious, the tautological subring is relatively well understood, and conjecturally completely understood. In this talk, I’ll ask the question: which cohomology groups \(H^k(\bar{M}_{g,n})\) are tautological? And when they are not, how can we better understand them?

The problem with this method is that, once we leave the hyperbolic space, the visual boundary of a metric space may not be QI invariant any more. This motivated people to try to find good characterizations of hyperbolic-like directions in non-hyperbolic spaces. For example, people have studied the Morse boundary and contracting boundary of CAT(0) spaces. However, this task is particularly hard to accomplish in higher rank symmetric spaces. The existence of an isometrically embedded copy of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) for \(n \geq 2\) around every geodesic segment precludes any plausible characterizations for hyperbolicity being satisfied. Our goal is to develop a useful notion of sublinear Morse-ness of the action of a discrete subgroup \(\Gamma \subset Isom(X)\) on a higher rank symmetric space $X$ and show that this gives rise to a well defined, QI invariant boundary that has full measure with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure defined by \(\Gamma\).</p> <br> </details> <div style="height:6px;font-size:5px;"> </div> <details> <summary>9:30-10 am: <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~tjwei/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Teddy Weisman</a>, <strong>Dehn filling in semisimple Lie groups</strong>.</summary> <p> </p> <p><em>Abstract:</em> Thurston’s Hyperbolic Dehn Filling Theorem is a seminal result in the theory of \(3\)-manifolds.

Blair</a>, <strong>Eigenfunction Bounds on Riemannian Manifolds of Nonpositive Curvature</strong>.</summary> <p> </p> <p><em>Abstract:</em> The Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold is known to be diagonalizable, meaning there exists an orthonormal basis for \(L^2\) consisting of eigenfunctions of the operator. For decades, there has been significant interest in establishing upper bounds on the growth of \(L^p\) norms of these eigenfunctions in the high-frequency limit. These bounds have considerable implications for the theory of spectral multipliers and PDEs on Riemannian manifolds. They are closely related to the Stein-Tomas restriction theorem for the Fourier transform and provide insights into how an eigenfunction might concentrate its mass throughout the manifold.</p> <p>A seminal result by Sogge in the 1980s provides \(L^p\) bounds on eigenfunctions that are “universal,” meaning they apply to any Riemannian manifold, regardless of its geometry. However, they are not typically the best possible ones. Indeed, proofs of the universal bounds generally rely on local properties of geodesics rather than their global dynamics. In recent years, it has been shown that the eigenfunctions on manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature satisfy better bounds. In this talk, we will discuss these developments, with an emphasis on recent progress in joint works with Sogge and Huang concerning the case of critical exponents.</p> <br> </details> <div style="height:25px;font-size:5px;"> </div> <h2 id="how-to-get-to-riverside">How to get to Riverside</h2> <p>If you are landing at Ontario International Airport, the best way to get to Riverside (and your hotel) is by taking an Uber or a Lyft.
