### Reading seminars

+ ***Anosov representations*** (to appear): reading group at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), with [Sara Maloni](https://sites.google.com/view/sara-maloni) and [Alec Traaseth](https://sites.google.com/view/alec-traaseth/home). Our main reference were [Dick Canary](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~canary/)'s "informal [lecture notes](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~canary/Anosovlecnotes.pdf)" on Anosov representations.

My main references were: Donaldson, _[Moment maps in differential geometry](https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/files/_fulltext/journals/sdg/2003/0008/0001/SDG-2003-0008-0001-a006.pdf)_; Hodge, _[Ph.D. thesis](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/8115/1/Hodge-TWS-2005-PhD-Thesis.pdf)_; Trautwein, _[Ph.D. thesis](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/281862)_. Here are my notes:
  + [Part 1 - Outline and preliminaries on symplectic reduction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11HHeSHCCoEdPEuA8oQx1pxtJ1hRt7IvE/view?usp=sharing).

### Some Math in Italian

**Disclaimer!** The material appearing below is a quite random collection of notes from my Master studies at the [Università di Pisa](https://www.unipi.it). These are NOT intended to be in any way complete references: bibliographies are not present or incomplete, they may very likely contain mistakes, and they have not been updated since I have taken these classes. Everyone is welcome to consult them, but at their own risk!

### Miscellaneous

Here you can find my [Master thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10smOiltlBMaXMZtwzUHtg_7LrSCCx9jF/view?usp=sharing) on the representation theory of the quantum Teichmüller space. To every native English speaker: my sincerest apologies for having barbarically murdered your language at the time (fortunately I got a bit better at it now).
