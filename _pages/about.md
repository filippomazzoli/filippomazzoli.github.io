Currently I am a post-doc in Mathematics and I am part of [Anna Wienhard's research group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/geometry-groups-dynamics/index.html) at the [MPI MIS](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig. Later (July 2024) I will join the Math department at [UC Riverside](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/) as a tenure-track assistant professor.

From August 2020 to May 2023, I was a post-doc at the [University of Virginia](https://math.virginia.edu), where my mentor was Prof. [Sara Maloni](https://sites.google.com/view/sara-maloni). I defended my [Ph.D. thesis](https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/43901/1/thesis_main.pdf) in July 2020 at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu), under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Schlenker](http://math.uni.lu/schlenker/). I studied for my Bachelor and Master at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english).

My areas of research are Geometric Topology and Differential Geometry. I am particularly interested in the study of (higher) Teichmüller spaces, surface group representations, and geometric structures on low-dimensional manifolds, in  particular hyperbolic and anti-de Sitter 3-manifolds.

Together with [Sam Fairchild](https://sites.google.com/view/sfairchild/home), [James Farre](https://sites.google.com/site/jamesfarremath/), and [Kostas Tsouvalas](https://sites.google.com/view/konstantinos-tsouvalas/home), I am organizing the Geometry Seminar at the [MPI MIS](https://www.mis.mpg.de/).
