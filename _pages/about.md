Since August 2024, I am an assistant professor in Mathematics at the [University of California Riverside](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/).

Before that, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher in Mathematics, first at the [University of Virginia](https://math.virginia.edu) (August 2020-May 2023), where my mentor was [Sara Maloni](https://sites.google.com/view/sara-maloni) and, more recently, at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig, as part of [Anna Wienhard's research group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/geometry-groups-dynamics). I defended my [Ph.D. thesis](https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/43901/1/thesis_main.pdf) in July 2020 at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu), under the supervision of Prof. [Jean-Marc Schlenker](http://math.uni.lu/schlenker/). I studied for my Bachelor and Master at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english).

My areas of research are Geometric Topology and Differential Geometry. I am particularly interested in the study of (higher) Teichm√ºller spaces, surface group representations, and geometric structures on low-dimensional manifolds, in  particular hyperbolic and anti-de Sitter 3-manifolds.
