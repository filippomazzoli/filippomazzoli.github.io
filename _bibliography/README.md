## My personal academic CV (latest version [here](https://github.com/filippomazzoli/academic-CV/blob/main/TeX-files/main.pdf))

This template differs very little from prometheusCV (available [here](https://github.com/chrisby/prometheusCV/)). The main changes I made concern the list of publications.
I included this [GitHub action](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action) to generate the .pdf file.
